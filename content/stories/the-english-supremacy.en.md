# The English Supremacy

## DESCRIPTION
At this time, England likely produced half of Europe’s (and therefore the world’s) total watch output, but — like France — it faced a growing flow of imports, mostly from Switzerland and often smuggled.

In the 18th century, British prestige was high and the market so rich that the Dutch and Swiss developed entire industries making “pseudo-London” timepieces. Some of these pieces were expensive, highly decorated objects.

By 1764, the London Clockmakers’ Company felt pressured to act against the smuggling of Geneva watches.
