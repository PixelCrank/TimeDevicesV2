# The Drunkard’s Key

## DESCRIPTION
With very rare exceptions, watches had always been wound using a key — a system that worked fairly well, except that key winding was rather inconvenient, especially for older people whose hands trembled when trying to place the key on the winding square.

Another disadvantage of this system was that if the key was turned the wrong way, the risk of damaging the mechanism was high. For this reason, manufacturers considered it necessary to engrave an arrow around the winding hole to remind the user to turn the key to the right.

Those who could afford it used Breguet keys with a built-in ratchet — in English, tipsy keys or “drunkard’s keys” — so named because they could only turn to the right and were thus safe from mistakes made in a drunken state.
