# From Seasonal Time to Fixed Time

## DESCRIPTION
From the 14th century, public mechanical clocks spread from Italy across Europe, striking the hours automatically and becoming ubiquitous in cities.

## FUNCTION
First to structure religious life (offices, prayer), then to organise collective urban time for clergy, artisans and merchants.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
A shift from natural, seasonal time toward an abstract, measurable, shared time that orders social, economic and political life.

## INNOVATION
Marks the revolution from seasonal to fixed timeâ€”indispensable to modern societies.
