# The Smuggling of Watches

## DESCRIPTION
For collectors, the typical Parisian timepiece of the second half of the 18th century was almost always made in Geneva, though signed “Paris” and housed in a gold case. Aristocratic women’s wedding baskets were full of them.

A large portion of these watches entered France illegally: smuggling was not a crime but a trade. Risky, yes — but volumes were so large, and odds of success so well calculated, that shipments could be insured at modest rates against seizure.

One method used by Geneva houses was to hide watches in dirty, foul-smelling loads — fish in particular — that customs officers were reluctant to search.

The profits were so high that Geneva’s fishmongers even tried (unsuccessfully) to muscle in and establish themselves as intermediaries.

This trafficking contributed to the collapse of the French watch industry in the second half of the 18th century.
