# The Rise of Mass Production

## DESCRIPTION
From mid‑19th century the US led a shift toward mechanised manufacture and standardised parts.

## FUNCTION
Large lots were sorted by size/strength and combined rather than hand‑finished one‑by‑one.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Industry moved from perfection of each part to mastering variability through volume and selection.

## INNOVATION
Ironically, mass methods yielded more precise, robust and cheaper watches than many artisan makes.
