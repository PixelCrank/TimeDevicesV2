# The Barter of Unsold Watches

## DESCRIPTION
After trade fairs or long journeys, watch merchants who failed to sell all their stock often resorted to bartering. Rather than bringing unsold watches back to Geneva, they exchanged them locally for other goods: spices, cloth, clothing, toys, etc.

## FUNCTION
Merchants and dealers used this practice as a last resort to avoid transporting unsold stock back. Once back in Geneva, they resold the goods obtained by barter, sometimes even imposing them directly on watchmakers as a form of payment!

The latter, often poor, thus found themselves forced to accept goods of no use to them.

## PERSPECTIVE
In a still largely pre-industrial economy based on trade-fair networks, sales were uncertain and unsold stock heavily impacted margins. Barter appeared as a pragmatic form of compensation but also revealed the limits of an imbalanced system in which watchmaking workers were the adjustment variable.
