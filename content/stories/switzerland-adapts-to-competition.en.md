# Switzerland Adapts to Competition

## DESCRIPTION
Faced with competition from mass-produced American watches, the Swiss watch industry opted for a hybrid strategy: partially adopting mechanized production while preserving artisanal flexibility and high-end quality.

## WHAT
Instead of fully imitating the American model, the Swiss selectively introduced the interchangeability of spare parts, without sacrificing craftsmanship. Their factories remained smaller, combining machine and hand tasks, relying on subcontracting and home work, and maintaining a strong orientation toward complicated watches, fine finishing, and luxury.

## WHY
This flexibility and versatility, inherited from their artisanal tradition, became the major strengths of Swiss watchmaking in the face of global industrialization. By adapting in this way, Switzerland managed to conquer all segments of the market: from popular models to mechanical masterpieces. This gentle adaptation strategy ensured the resilience and lasting influence of Swiss watchmaking.

## STORY+
The roles reversed: two generations after observing American factories, the Swiss themselves became technical benchmarks. American brands secretly imported Patek or Audemars movements, assembled them locally, and signed them with their own names, erasing all Swiss origin. Even today, some collectors mistakenly believe these pieces to be American-made.
