# Switzerland Adapts to Competition

## DESCRIPTION
By ~1880 Switzerland adopted a hybrid strategy: selective interchangeability with preserved craft flexibility and luxury focus.

## FUNCTION
Factories stayed smaller, mixing machine and handwork with subcontracting and home work.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
This flexibility became a key competitive advantage across all market segments.

## INNOVATION
Two generations later, Swiss movements quietly powered ‘American’‑branded watches.
