# Switzerland Dominates the Market

## DESCRIPTION
Switzerland now accounted for more than two-thirds of global watch production in value. Thanks to its network of know-how, gradual industrialization, and the adaptability of its artisans, it became the world’s leading watchmaking power.

## WHAT
As watches became democratized throughout Europe, Switzerland seized the opportunity and structured an industry capable of meeting global demand, combining deeply rooted local traditions, a skilled workforce, and an ability to absorb innovations from abroad.

Other countries struggled to keep up:
	• The United Kingdom, once the master of the industry, missed the turning point and saw its watchmaking decline while it dominated nearly every other sector.
	• France resisted thanks to Besançon, but Paris, once a prestigious center, largely sourced from Switzerland and produced only a handful of art watches.
	• The Netherlands had lost their watchmaking tradition, and Germany remained marginal.

## WHY
Swiss success revealed a rare ability to combine traditional craftsmanship with gentle modernization. While other nations hesitated between artisanal and machine methods, Switzerland adopted a hybrid and resilient model. In contrast, British stagnation in watchmaking foreshadowed a broader industrial decline. Neglecting this sector — a true barometer of economic change — was a warning signal that went unheeded.

## STORY+
In Besançon, the Swiss colony played a decisive role in training a new generation of French watchmakers and structuring the regional industry.
