# The Longitude Sea Act

## DESCRIPTION
The British Parliament’s 1714 Longitude Act offered large prizes for a practical way to determine longitude at sea.

## FUNCTION
Mariners and merchants needed reliable east‑west position to avoid wrecks and improve charts; official tests were real ocean crossings.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Earlier celestial proposals by Galileo, Huygens, Newton and Halley proved impractical at sea.

## INNOVATION
The chronometer contest linked mastery of time to mastery of the world and catalysed scientific timekeeping.
