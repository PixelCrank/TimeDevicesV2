# The Chronometer that Built an Empire

## DESCRIPTION
The famous British navigator James Cook used a chronometer derived from John Harrison’s H-4 during his daring three-year voyage around the globe, including the crossing of the Antarctic Circle.

This watch, built by Larcum Kendall — who had previously helped Harrison develop the H-4 — was named K-1 (Kendall-1).

The K-1 maintained remarkable precision, deviating by only one minute over three years of stormy seas and extreme temperatures ranging from the tropics to Antarctic ice. This success confirmed Harrison’s chronometer as the most reliable for determining longitude.

Following this brilliant demonstration, many watchmakers were called upon to produce chronometers, leading to rapid growth of the British watch industry.

Armed with mastery of time and the sea, Britain could sail freely across oceans, establish colonies worldwide, and assert its maritime supremacy.

There is no doubt that Harrison’s chronometer played a key role in the prosperity of the British Empire, which in the 19th century became both master of the seas and workshop of the world.
