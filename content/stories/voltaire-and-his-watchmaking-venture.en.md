# Voltaire and His Watchmaking Venture

## DESCRIPTION
Voltaire, settled in Ferney in 1759, played a role in developing local watchmaking by attracting Geneva artisans to establish workshops in the village.

Jean-Antoine Lépine, renowned watchmaker and clockmaker to King Louis XV, collaborated with Voltaire in this enterprise.

The precise details of their collaboration are only partially documented, but several sources indicate that Lépine was involved in the Ferney watchmaking manufacture. For example, a movement signed “Manufacture Royale de Ferney” and numbered 6, dated 1770, testifies to this association.

According to some sources, Lépine may have acted as an agent for Voltaire’s workshops in Ferney, transferring his Parisian business to Place Dauphine in 1772. Other accounts suggest Lépine directed Voltaire’s workshops, though his exact role remains unclear.

An unsigned memoir of 1784 reports that Lépine stayed in Ferney for 18 months and that watch movements worth 90,000 livres per year were produced there.
