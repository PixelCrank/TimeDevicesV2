# The Piguet Family – Among the First Settlers

## DESCRIPTION
From the 13th century, the Piguet family (then called Peguet or Pegay) came to graze their cattle in the Vallée de Joux, then chose to settle there permanently despite harsh winters. Little by little, they cleared land, built homes, and founded hamlets, some of which still bear their name: Piguet-dessus, La Piguette…

Centuries later, the Piguets were pioneers again, this time in watchmaking.Daniel Piguet (1733–1813), first watchmaker of the lineage, began his apprenticeship in 1749 with David Golay, trained by Samuel Olivier Meylan, the very first watchmaker of the valley. In 1753, another Piguet, Abraham Isaac (1738–1826), also started under David’s brother.

At that time, families were large and houses small. The young Joseph (1748–1825), Abraham Isaac’s younger brother, was only five years old. One can imagine him fascinated by what his elder brother showed him: gears, mechanisms, workshop gestures. His vocation was born.

In 1769, his masterpiece enabled him to join the Watchmakers’ Corporation. He kept his small silver watch, later passed down from generation to generation, until Edward Auguste Piguet, co-founder of Audemars Piguet.

Today, this symbolic watch belongs to Olivier Audemars, 4th generation and vice-president of the company. It is displayed at the Musée Atelier Audemars Piguet, in Le Brassus, the brand’s historical heart.
