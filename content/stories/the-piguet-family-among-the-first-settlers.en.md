# The Piguet Family – Among the First Settlers

## DESCRIPTION
From the 13th century the Piguet family grazed and settled the Vallée de Joux, founding hamlets that bear their name.

## FUNCTION
By the 18th century they turned to horology; a small 1769 watch became a family emblem passed down to Audemars Piguet leaders.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
The valley’s harsh setting forged resilience and craft traditions.

## INNOVATION
Today the emblematic watch is displayed at the Musée Atelier Audemars Piguet in Le Brassus.
