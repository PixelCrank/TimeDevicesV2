# The World Championships of Precision

## DESCRIPTION
The annual chronometry competition of Kew, then Teddington, was considered the world championship of watch precision. It attracted the best British artisans, until the Swiss entered the contest.

## WHAT
From the early 20th century, Swiss manufacturers sent their best instruments to Kew to compete. Despite the logistical challenge (precise adjustments, risky postal transport), the results spoke for themselves. In 1903, Paul Ditisheim won first prize, and from 1907 onward, the Swiss won first prize every year in the pocket watch category. The great names followed: Patek Philippe, Vacheron Constantin, Zenith, Movado, Longines, Omega.

## WHY 
This shift symbolized a reversal of the global watchmaking hierarchy: the British, long dominant, lost their last symbolic bastion. The Swiss combined innovation, material investment, and recruitment of exceptional talent, progressively surpassing all their competitors.

## STORY+
Swiss brands owed much of their success to their network of suppliers in the Jura Arc. Charles Thomann paid tribute to these shadow artisans, these “dignitaries of watchmaking,” whose anonymous work allowed the great houses to shine.
