# A New Perception of Time

## DESCRIPTION
As mechanical clocks spread, time became a measurable, secular resource rather than a purely divine gift.

## FUNCTION
Merchants, artisans and workers used measured hours to schedule labour and maximise productivity, challenging the Church’s earlier taboos on ‘selling time’.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Medieval Christian tradition treated time as God’s; fixed time ruptured that view amid urban growth of trade and craft.

## INNOVATION
Time becomes economic capital and a tool of social control, paving the way for modern capitalism.
