# From Seasonal Time to Fixed Time

## DESCRIPTION
From the 14th century, the public mechanical clock—capable of automatically striking each hour (once at 1:00, twice at 2:00, etc.)—spread from Italy to Germany, France, and England. Its use was first encouraged by the Christian Church and adopted in churches and monasteries, before extending to civic buildings (town halls, market squares) in the 15th and 16th centuries. By the late 16th century, improved accuracy led to clocks becoming standard in all cities.

## FUNCTION
Initially installed to structure religious life (prayers, offices), public clocks became a central tool of collective organization. They allowed residents of the same city to share the same temporal rhythm and to coordinate activities—work, trade, and civic life—at predetermined times.

## PERSPECTIVE
Traditionally, time in European societies had been governed by natural cycles: sunrise and sunset, the agricultural seasons, and the rhythm of church bells. In the countryside, this logic persisted. In cities, however, a new era emerged: an abstract, measurable, shared time that would come to structure social, economic, and political life.

## INNOVATION
The widespread adoption of mechanical clocks marks a revolution in the history of temporality: the shift from seasonal time to fixed time (linear and uniform). Europe gradually developed a collective awareness of measured time, organizing urban activities according to a standardized rhythm—an essential element in the development of modern societies.
