# From Seasonal Time to Fixed Time

## DESCRIPTION
Starting in the 14th century, public mechanical clocks — capable of automatically striking each hour (once at 1 o’clock, twice at 2 o’clock, etc.) — spread from Italy to Germany, France and England. Their use was initially encouraged by the Christian Church and adopted in churches and monasteries across Europe, before extending to civic buildings (town halls, market squares) in the 15th and 16th centuries. By the end of the 16th century, improved clock accuracy led to their generalization in cities everywhere.

## FUNCTION
Initially installed to structure religious life (prayers, services), public clocks became a central tool of collective organization. They allowed city inhabitants — whether clerics, artisans or merchants — to synchronize their activities.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Prior to this, the perception of time was still primarily dictated by natural cycles: sunrise and sunset, agricultural seasons, the ringing of church bells. In the countryside this logic endured. In cities, however, a new era emerged: that of an abstract, measurable and shared time that would structure social, economic and political life.

## INNOVATION
The widespread adoption of mechanical clocks marked a revolution in the history of timekeeping: the shift from seasonal time to fixed, linear time. Europe gradually witnessed the emergence of a collective awareness of measured time and the structuring of urban activities according to a standardized rhythm. This innovation became an indispensable element in the development of modern societies.”
