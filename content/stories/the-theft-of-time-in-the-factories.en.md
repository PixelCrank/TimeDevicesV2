# The Theft of Time in the Factories

## DESCRIPTION
As industrialization began in rural England, workers often suspected their bosses of cheating them with manipulated factory clocks.

The difference between the time given by the factory clock and other local clocks seemed, in many cases, to confirm their suspicions.

To defend themselves, many workers bought their own watches — usually cheap “onions” costing £2. Employers did not look kindly on their men arming themselves in this way.

Given the inaccuracy of these instruments, it is possible that such claims were more a pretext for disputes than a serious basis for disagreement.
