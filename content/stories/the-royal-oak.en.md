# The Royal Oak

## DESCRIPTION
The Royal Oak was presented on April 15, 1972 at the Basel Fair. It was born in 1970 from a request made to Audemars Piguet by three distributors seeking a steel sports watch, but with the elegance of luxury.

Director Georges Golay entrusted this challenge to Gérald Genta, who in one night sketched a revolutionary model: an octagonal case with visible screws, textured dial, integrated bracelet, and steel finished with the care of a precious metal. It would take two years and the best Swiss artisans to realize it.

## FUNCTION
Designed for a modern, active, wealthy clientele, the Royal Oak offered a chic and audacious alternative to classic gold watches. It targeted those who wanted to display a different kind of luxury, adapted to an urban, casual lifestyle while remaining refined.

## PERSPECTIVE
The 1970s marked a period of cultural and technological transformation. Swiss watchmaking was under pressure from the rise of Japanese quartz. Time became not only a precious good but also a personal one, and watches were no longer merely utilitarian: they became identity objects. In this context, offering a luxury watch in steel was a calculated provocation.

## INNOVATION
The Royal Oak overturned conventions: steel became noble, design became message.
It launched the trend of the luxury sports watch, now ubiquitous. Though controversial at its debut, it sold 490 units in its first year — a record for Audemars Piguet. It embodied a new vision of luxury, one that would durably influence the watch industry and enthusiasts’ expectations.
