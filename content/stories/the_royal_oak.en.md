# The Royal Oak

## DESCRIPTION
Commissioned by Audemars Piguet’s Georges Golay for a luxury steel sports watch, Gérald Genta sketched the Royal Oak overnight in 1970; launched at Basel on 15 April 1972.

## FUNCTION
Served a modern, urban, affluent clientele seeking a bold alternative to gold dress watches.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Amid the quartz shock, ‘steel made noble’—design as message in a changing culture.

## INNOVATION
Pioneered the luxury‑sports category; controversial at first, it later reshaped expectations industry‑wide.
