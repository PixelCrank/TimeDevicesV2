# The Cabinotier (Workshop Watchmaker)

## DESCRIPTION
As structures evolved, more artisans worked independently as cabinotiers in small top‑floor workshops, linked to merchant‑manufacturers by agents.

## FUNCTION
Provided specialised parts and finishing on demand within the broader ‘Fabrique’ network.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
A dense urban craft ecosystem (notably Geneva’s Saint‑Gervais) powered global reach before electricity.

## INNOVATION
Distributed expertise across many micro‑workshops, enabling flexibility and variety at scale.
