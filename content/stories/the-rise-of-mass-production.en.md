# The Rise of Mass Production

## DESCRIPTION
From the mid-19th century, watchmaking very gradually entered the industrial era. The United States took the lead by adapting principles of serial manufacturing to watch production, with a new approach: the standardization of parts.

## WHAT
Watchmaking ceased to be exclusively artisanal. Although pioneers like Frédéric Japy produced ébauches in series as early as 1777 in France, these parts were not yet interchangeable: each watch still had to be adjusted by hand. It was the Americans who first made significant advances by producing very large lots of parts which they then sorted by size (jewels, pivots) or strength (balance spring) and adjusted by combination rather than individual finishing.

## WHY
This evolution depended less on machines than on a new industrial logic: it was no longer about making each part perfect, but about mastering variability through mass production and selection. There was no longer any need for a specialized artisan for every component: this was the birth of assembly-line watchmaking.

## STORY+
Ironically, although based on imperfection (producing parts in bulk without them being identical), this method led to watches that were more precise, more robust, and far cheaper than their artisanal counterparts.
