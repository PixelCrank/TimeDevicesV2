# The System of Établissage

## DESCRIPTION
At the beginning of the 17th century in Geneva, corporate restrictions prevented non-citizens from practicing the trade of watchmaker. To get around these barriers, some master watchmakers split production into specialized stages, entrusted to different artisans—often outside the framework of guild rules.

## FUNCTION
The system benefited enterprising merchants and master watchmakers, who could produce more at lower cost. It also made it possible to employ artisans outside the guilds, including rural workers, women, and youths—thus meeting strong market demand while bypassing the social and legal restrictions of the time.

## PERSPECTIVE
At that time, work was tightly regulated by guilds that protected trades and the status of established artisans.
Meanwhile, watchmaking was booming in Europe, with Geneva as a major center. Établissage reflected a shift toward a more flexible economy, based on decentralized production and rationalized labor.

## INNOVATION
Établissage marked a key step toward pre-industrial production. It anticipated the division of labor that Adam Smith would later theorize. It contributed to the gradual democratization of the watchmaking profession and to the rise of the Swiss watch industry, creating an economic ecosystem based on collaboration between town and countryside, artisans and merchants. This organization laid the foundations of the future Swiss industrial model.
