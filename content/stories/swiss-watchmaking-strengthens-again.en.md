# Swiss Watchmaking Strengthens Again

## DESCRIPTION
The Second World War, far from hindering Swiss watchmaking, consolidated its global dominance. Thanks to its neutrality, Switzerland benefited first from increased military demand, then from a strong civilian rebound.

## WHAT
At the end of the war, military demand collapsed abruptly, but this time there was no crisis: civilian demand, long suppressed, exploded. Swiss watches became a coveted product, for which people sometimes paid premiums or under-the-table sums, similar to the postwar automobile market.

## WHY
Swiss neutrality allowed its industry to continue producing during the conflict. After the war, the image and reputation of Swiss watches were at their highest: Swiss Made had become synonymous with elegance, reliability, and precision. Around 1949, Swiss watches represented more than 80% of world production in value — a historic record.

## STORY+
The United States imposed high customs duties to try to stem the flow of Swiss watches which, aided by flourishing smuggling, did not decrease. According to Dumaine, then head of Waltham, Swiss watch smuggling already reached 1–2 million movements per year in the 1930s.
