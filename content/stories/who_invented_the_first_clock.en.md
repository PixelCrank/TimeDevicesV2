# Who Invented the First Clock?

## DESCRIPTION
For a long time, the invention of the mechanical clock was attributed to Gerbert of Aurillac, who became Pope Sylvester II around the year 1000. Educated in mathematics and astronomy in Spain, Gerbert reportedly brought back advanced knowledge, building a celestial globe and armillary spheres. His student, the monk Richer, mentions these instruments, suggesting that Gerbert had the skills necessary to design a clock.
However, no contemporary evidence confirms that he built such a device. Moreover, it is unlikely that such a useful invention would have remained unused for three centuries before the documented appearance of tower clocks in the 14th century. We find neither material traces of it, nor any mention in texts or images of the time.
Some have hypothesized that if Gerbert had indeed built a mechanical clock, the Church might have suppressed it, fearing an invention linked to Arabic knowledge or even sorcery. His posthumous reputation as a magician was indeed leveraged by Protestants to attack the papacy.
But this idea is based on flimsy speculation. Why would the Church have rejected a tool so valuable for regulating liturgical time? And could it really have erased all trace of it?
As it stands, the invention of the mechanical clock remains attributed to 14th-century engineers such as Giovanni de Dondi, who left documented models and precise descriptions.”
