# Who Invented the First Clock?

## DESCRIPTION
For centuries some credited Gerbert of Aurillac (Pope Sylvester II) with inventing a mechanical clock around the year 1000, but no contemporary proof exists.

## FUNCTION

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
If such a useful device had existed, it would not have gone unused until the 14th century; no textual, visual or material trace survives.

## INNOVATION
The mechanical clock is best attributed to 14th‑century engineers like Giovanni de Dondi, who left documented models and descriptions.
