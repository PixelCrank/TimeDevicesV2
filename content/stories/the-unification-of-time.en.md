# The Unification of Time

## DESCRIPTION
From the second half of the 19th century, the need to synchronize railway networks led to the unification of time on a national, then global scale. Greenwich became the time center of the planet.

## WHAT
In 1847, the British Railway Clearing House recommended that all British railway companies adopt Greenwich time in their stations, as soon as transmission by the Post Office allowed it. This decision marked a turning point: local time, unique to each city, gave way to unified time.

## WHY
Unified time made industrial and social organization more efficient. It eliminated delays and confusion linked to multiple schedules and reinforced the practical value of the watch in daily life. Time became a collective tool of coordination, and exact time an imperative shared on the scale of a country, then the Western and colonial world. In 1884, at the International Conference in Washington, the Greenwich meridian was officially adopted as the global reference.

## INNOVATION
Preferring the Paris Observatory, France opposed the move and resisted until 1911, instituting a bizarre formula: “Paris mean time, delayed by 9 minutes and 21 seconds” — in other words, Greenwich time. Eventually France gave in, but added a full hour to Greenwich — a habit that persists today with the UTC+1 time zone.
