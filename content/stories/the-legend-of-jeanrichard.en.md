# The Legend of Jeanrichard

## DESCRIPTION
A popular legend from Neuchâtel attributes the beginnings of watchmaking in the Jura mountains to Daniel Jean Richard (1665–1741).

As a teenager, he is said to have offered to repair an English horse dealer’s watch. He succeeded, and this led him to learn more about watches, travel to Geneva, and bring back tools and accessories.

With success came growth: he soon employed his sons and then a group of apprentices, who later opened their own workshops. Task subdivision allowed workers to quickly acquire skills, while women and children contributed to tasks that, in England, were reserved for qualified journeymen. This accelerated both development and profitability.

## PERSPECTIVE
Although it is plausible that a handful of innovators played a crucial role in the rise of watchmaking in the Swiss Jura, it is clear that Jean Richard was only one pioneer among other learned mountaineers (see linked entry).

Additionally, Protestant refugees fleeing France made a major contribution, bringing with them not only their experience and skills but also an entire network of commercial relationships essential to export activity. Geneva, nearby, served as a school for apprentices and a source of tools, supplies, and models to copy.
