# Switzerland on the Brink of Collapse

## DESCRIPTION
By 1979, amid quartz disruption, Swiss exports plunged (87M units in 1974 to 45M in 1981).

## FUNCTION
Persisting in mechanical prestige while delaying electronics led to cascading failures and job losses.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
‘Swiss Made’ had to be redefined as foreign components became essential.

## INNOVATION
Crisis forced standardisation and automation—changes that came late but proved necessary.
