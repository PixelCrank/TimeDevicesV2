# A New Perception of Time

## DESCRIPTION
With the spread of mechanical clocks in European cities, a new way of measuring time gradually took hold. This change transformed people’s relationship to time: it ceased to be seen as a divine gift and became a measurable, secularized and exploitable tool.

## FUNCTION
Merchants, artisans and workers embraced this measured time to organize working hours, maximize productivity and structure commercial exchanges. This appropriation of time for economic ends ran counter to the sacred vision of time promoted by the Church, which had previously condemned the selling or “monetization” of time (interest, loans).

## PERSPECTIVE
In medieval Christian tradition, time belonged to God, and any attempt to sell it or count it for profit was considered blasphemous. The arrival of fixed time introduced a rupture in this spiritual view. This transformation took place amid the growth of cities, commerce and crafts, where organizing work became paramount.

## INNOVATION
This shift in the perception of time had major consequences: time became a measurable economic factor, equivalent to a unit of production. The mechanical clock became a tool of social and political control serving urban merchant classes. This revolution in time-consciousness paved the way for modern capitalism, in which time — like money — became capital to be optimized.”
