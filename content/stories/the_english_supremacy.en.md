# The English Supremacy

## DESCRIPTION
In the 18th century England likely made about half of Europe’s watches while facing rising (often smuggled) Swiss imports.

## FUNCTION
Dutch and Swiss built industries producing ‘pseudo‑London’ watches, some luxurious and highly decorated.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
By 1764 London’s guild tried to curb Geneva contraband.

## INNOVATION
Prestige and wealth drew imitators; the struggle presaged later industrial competition.
