# The Audemars Family Facing Adversity

## DESCRIPTION
In the mid-16th century, religious wars shook Europe. Catholics, in power, repressed the reformers seeking to reinvent Christianity. In 1558, André Audemars (or Hodemart) fled persecution in France to take refuge in Geneva. Around 1580, his son Jacob became the first Audemars to settle in the Vallée de Joux.

The family quietly took root there. In 1635, it built a farm at Derrière les Grandes Roches, an isolated hamlet near Catholic Burgundy, then plagued by brigandage and frequent fires. Woodworking, cutting fine stones, and livestock shaped a simple, sometimes harsh life.

The winter of 1791–92 marked a tragic turning point. Suzanne Audemars, known as La Zanne, born Piguet, lost three children and her husband to an unknown epidemic, with no doctor to treat them. Left isolated with three children between 5 and 12 years old, she showed exceptional resilience.

A lapidary, she was also known as an herbalist, healer, and even smuggler. Supported by her community, she managed to have her sons trained in watchmaking — unknowingly laying the foundations of a watchmaking dynasty.

Among them, Louis-Benjamin, then 9 years old, would be the first Audemars to bring the family into the history of Swiss watchmaking.
