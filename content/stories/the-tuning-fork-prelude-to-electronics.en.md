# The Tuning Fork – Prelude to Electronics

## DESCRIPTION
Launched in 1960, the Bulova Accutron was the first mass-market electronic watch with a vibrating tuning fork. This technological breakthrough, the work of Swiss engineer Max Hetzel, marked a rupture in the race for precision and a setback for the Swiss watch industry, which had initially rejected the invention.

## WHAT
The mechanical escapement was replaced by a tuning fork vibrating at 360 Hz, offering unprecedented accuracy for the time. The watch was not supposed to drift more than one minute per month, i.e. ±2 seconds per day, throughout its lifespan. Quickly adopted by Bulova, several major Swiss houses eventually purchased licenses.

## WHY
The transition to electronics had begun. The Swiss, anchored in mechanical prestige, missed the opportunity for a major technological shift. American success showed that precision had become a central commercial argument, beyond artisanal know-how. This first revolution foreshadowed an even more formidable competitor: Japanese quartz, about to upend the entire sector.

## STORY+
The Accutron was adopted by NASA, used in Apollo dashboards, and even equipped certain space missions.
