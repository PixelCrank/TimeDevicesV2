# The Merchant-Manufacturer

## DESCRIPTION
    Many établisseurs went into trade and became merchant-manufacturers. Abraham Vacheron—founder of the house that would become Vacheron Constantin—is a good example. Others did the reverse: they began as merchants and later turned to manufacturing, such as Czapek and Patek (later Patek Philippe).

    The life and work of these merchant-manufacturers was certainly no unbroken series of rewards and profits. The very use of barter and payments in kind shows that not all watches were sold and that success depended on agility, flexibility, and nerve. They had to work hard and be personally involved: long journeys away from family, the dangers of the road, customs inspections, health risks, etc.

    Dangers of the trade
    Trunks filled with watches and jewelry attracted the greed of highway bandits. In Italy, banditry was so widespread that authorities tried to stamp it out through terror (example: J.-B. Vacheron traveling in 1818 on the road from Turin to Rome, p. 354). There were also dangers at sea, with Barbary pirates prowling the route from Marseilles to the Levant. Rather than killing their prisoners, they demanded ransom. Swiss apprentices and watchmakers who agreed to work in Constantinople often asked their employer to sign a contract promising to pay their ransom in case of capture.
