# The Longitude Sea Act

## DESCRIPTION
Enacted in 1714 by the British Parliament, the Longitude Act offered large rewards to anyone who could find a reliable way to determine longitude at sea.

Rewards were proportional to precision achieved:
• £10,000 for an accuracy of 1 degree
• £15,000 for 2/3 of a degree
• £20,000 for 1/2 degree (≈56 km or 2 minutes of time)

The challenge: reach a maximum error of 2.9 seconds per day despite the rolling and pitching of the sea.

The official test consisted of a six-week crossing between Great Britain and the West Indies under real navigation conditions. After many candidates and attempts, it was finally John Harrison’s H-4 that passed the test in 1762, with an error of less than 10 seconds during the crossing.

## FUNCTION
Navigators and merchants needed a reliable way to know their east–west position (longitude) to limit shipwrecks, avoid trajectory errors, and improve sea charts. This invention addressed a major economic, military, and scientific challenge.

## PERSPECTIVE
As early as the late 16th century, several European countries — Spain, Holland, France, England, Venice — had launched national prize projects. Thinkers such as Galileo, Huygens, Newton, and Halley explored methods based on celestial movements, but none produced a solution usable at sea.

## INNOVATION
This race for precision was a turning point in watchmaking history, establishing the link between control of time and control of the world. It laid the foundations of modern navigation and scientific time measurement, even influencing the rise of global capitalism.
