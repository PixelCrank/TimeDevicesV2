# The Barter of Unsold Watches

## DESCRIPTION
Merchants often bartered unsold stock after fairs or voyages, trading watches for goods (spices, cloth, toys) rather than hauling them back to Geneva.

## FUNCTION
Used to clear inventory; back home, merchants sometimes imposed these goods on poor watchmakers as payment.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Reflects risks and imbalances of pre‑industrial market networks dominated by fairs and intermediaries.

## INNOVATION
Shows how market frictions shifted burdens onto workers, exposing the system’s inequities.
