# The Rise of the Swiss Jura

## DESCRIPTION
In a very short time, the inhabitants of the Jura managed to specialize and produce high-quality pieces.

The workers of the Vallée de Joux soon showed their ability to make repeaters and calendar movements, which they sold not only to local manufacturers but also to Geneva houses.

The Jura manufacturers’ production flexibility was remarkable: no series was too small, and no order too unusual. Thus the industry was able to supply all markets, experiment with innovations, copy, and exploit the inventions of others.

If the Vallée de Joux — especially Le Brassus and Le Sentier — was the center of complicated watch production, Le Locle and Val-de-Travers specialized in chronometers. La Brévine produced chains for verge watches and other fusee instruments, while Val-de-Travers made the best specialized tools. Fleurier and its surroundings produced watches for the Chinese market.

The entry of the Swiss Jura into the market relied on the production of lower-cost models for broader outlets. Unable to compete with Jura Arc prices, Geneva positioned itself in the high-end sector, presenting the watch as jewelry and luxury ornament.
