# The Rise of the Swiss Jura

## DESCRIPTION
Jura makers quickly specialised and produced high‑quality pieces: Vallée de Joux for repeaters and calendars; Le Locle/Val‑de‑Travers for chronometers.

## FUNCTION
A highly flexible system served every niche, from complex mechanisms to affordable models for wider markets.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Swiss entry mixed innovation, copying and exploitation of others’ inventions; Geneva moved upmarket into luxury.

## INNOVATION
A diversified regional ecosystem became the backbone of Switzerland’s global rise.
