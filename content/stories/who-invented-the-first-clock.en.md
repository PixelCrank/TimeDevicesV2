# Who Invented the First Clock?

## DESCRIPTION
For a long time, the invention of the mechanical clock was attributed to Gerbert of Aurillac, who became Pope Sylvester II around the year 1000. Trained in mathematics and astronomy in Spain, Gerbert reportedly brought back advanced knowledge and built a globe and armillary spheres. His pupil, the monk Richer, mentions these instruments, suggesting Gerbert had the skills needed to design a clock.

However, there is no contemporary proof that he built such a device. It is also unlikely that an invention so useful would have gone unused for three centuries before the documented appearance of clocks in bell towers and belfries in the 14th century. We find neither material traces nor mentions in the texts or images of the period.

Some have hypothesized that, had Gerbert actually constructed a mechanical clock, the Church might have suppressed it, fearing an invention tied to Arabic knowledge—or even sorcery. His posthumous reputation as a magician was indeed used by Protestants to attack the papacy. But this idea rests on weak speculation: why would the Church reject such a useful tool for regulating liturgical time? And could it really have erased all trace of it?

Given what we know today, the invention of the mechanical clock is attributed to 14th-century engineers such as Giovanni de Dondi, who left documented models and precise descriptions. (Reference in the text: L’heure qu’il est, p. 94.)
