# The Cabinotier (Workshop Watchmaker)

## DESCRIPTION
Over time, the old hierarchical workshop dissolved, and more artisans — including établisseurs working for clients — began working independently as cabinotiers (“cabinet” = small workshop).

Their only connection to the broader production system was via agents of merchant-manufacturers, who brought them work and collected finished pieces.

Reactions were mixed: some praised the prosperity of “La Fabrique” overall; others lamented the loss of innocence and quality.

## PERSPECTIVE
The global reputation of Geneva’s pre-industrial watchmaking rested on what was then called “La Fabrique” — the vast network of countless cabinotiers: watchmakers, jewelers, engravers, chain-makers, enamelers, diamond-cutters…

Imagine a dense network of artisans, working mostly at the tops of buildings (for light, before electricity), first in the old town, then in Saint-Gervais.
“Visit the Saint-Gervais quarter; all the watchmaking of Europe seems gathered there,” wrote Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a native, to encyclopedist d’Alembert.
