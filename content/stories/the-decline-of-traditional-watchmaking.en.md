# The Decline of Traditional Watchmaking

## DESCRIPTION
Despite their meteoric rise in the 19th century, American watchmaking companies ended up being overtaken — not only by Swiss houses but also by American assemblers.

## WHAT
American manufacturers lost ground to two types of competitors:
• American assemblers such as Bulova, Benrus, Gruen, or Longines-Wittnauer, who merely cased Swiss movements locally.
• Swiss brands themselves, more agile and inventive, who took the lead in reactivity, design, and precision.

## WHY
American assemblers better targeted the market, relying on advertising, radio slogans, and a sharp knowledge of modern marketing. By contrast, the large American manufacturers, centered on mass production, failed to adapt to the abandonment of pocket watches in favor of wristwatches, as well as to the rise of branding power.

## STORY+
The watch market changed paradigms: technical innovation was no longer enough — communication and style now dominated the scene. By betting on fashion and performance, the Swiss anticipated the change of era better than anyone.
