# The System of Établissage

## DESCRIPTION
In 17th‑century Geneva, restrictive guild rules spurred a decentralised network of specialised subcontractors producing parts in stages—établissage.

## FUNCTION
Enabled ambitious merchants and masters to raise output and costs efficiency, employing non‑guild labour including rural workers, women and youths.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Signals a move toward flexible, decentralised pre‑industrial production in a booming European craft centre.

## INNOVATION
Prefigures division of labour later theorised by Adam Smith and underpins the rise of Swiss watchmaking.
