# The Beginnings of the Great Repositioning

## DESCRIPTION
In the 1980s, faced with the relative failure of their response to Japanese quartz, Swiss brands realized that survival would not come from technology alone but from a profound redefinition of their identity.

## WHAT
Almost all Swiss brands eventually adopted quartz, but without massive success.
Swiss watchmaking began its repositioning in the ultra-luxury sector. The watch was no longer just an instrument for measuring time; it became a social, artistic, or cultural symbol, reflecting the owner’s tastes and status.

## WHY
The industry understood that its competitive advantage no longer lay in precision but in prestige and heritage. This was the beginning of a turn toward contemporary haute horlogerie, which would become Switzerland’s trademark and establish its unchallenged dominance in the following decades.

## STORY+
The new slogans chosen by brands perfectly illustrate the paradigm shift, moving from tool to fetish:
	•	Audemars Piguet promised an “exclusive creation for a few rare connoisseurs.”
	•	Patek Philippe did not sell the hour but a watch that “tells you who you are.”
	•	Vacheron Constantin spoke of a “rare and precious work of art.”
	•	Breguet presented itself as “a watchmaking legend.”
	•	Piaget boasted of producing “the most expensive watch in the world.”
