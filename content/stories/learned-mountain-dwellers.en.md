# Learned Mountain Dwellers

## DESCRIPTION
We have testimony from contemporaries as early as the 18th century attesting to the education and intellectual curiosity of these mountain people, and their distinctiveness is beyond doubt. All knew how to read, write, and do arithmetic—girls as well as boys—and their reading was not limited to the Bible.

We know they had small libraries containing travelogues, works of natural science and philosophy, histories, and biographies—in short, the libraries of self-taught, cultivated people. Le Locle and its surroundings were sufficient to sustain one of the best bookshops in Western Europe, one that would have done honor to Paris or London. The region also seems to have been a true hothouse of mechanical invention and scientific experimentation—a Benjamin-Franklin-style nursery, Jura-fashion.
