# The Merchant-Manufacturer

## DESCRIPTION
Many établisseurs turned to trade and became merchant‑manufacturers; others started as merchants then moved into production (e.g., Czapek, Patek).

## FUNCTION
They travelled harsh routes and seas, carrying valuable stock and facing banditry and piracy; success demanded agility and nerve.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Trade networks (Levant, Italy) were risky yet vital; bartering and payment in kind reflect uncertain markets.

## INNOVATION
Expanded international reach of watchmaking while exposing structural vulnerabilities of pre‑industrial commerce.
