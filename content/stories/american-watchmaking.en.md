# American Watchmaking

## DESCRIPTION
From 1850, the United States laid the foundations of a modern industrial watchmaking sector. Around the Waltham Watch Company, a new model emerged based on mechanized manufacturing, standardization, and mass production.

## WHAT
In 1850, Denison, Howard, and Curtis founded the company that would become Waltham Watch Company. The beginnings were laborious: their first movement (without fusee, with two mainsprings) proved unstable. It would take seven years of corrections and several restructurings to achieve the 1857 model, reliable and reproducible. In 1859, the firm became American Watch Company, with a factory dedicated to machine tools.

## WHY
Here was born a typically American model of watchmaking, based on mechanized production, standardized components, and reduced costs through mass machining. The Civil War increased demand because the army needed reliable watches. Between 1858 and 1864, Waltham produced more than 100,000 watches, including the Ellery model, which alone accounted for half of sales. For the United States, this was the birth of an industry, though on the scale of Switzerland it was still just a small cloud on the horizon.

## STORY+
The 1857 model marked the turning point toward truly industrial production, and the Ellery watch became emblematic of the American soldier in 1865. Walthamâ€™s success inspired many American competitors, and the following brands emerged: Howard (1857), Elgin (1864), Illinois (1869), Hampden (1877), Waterbury (1879), Hamilton (1892).
