# The Audemars Family Facing Adversity

## DESCRIPTION
Religious wars pushed André Audemars to Geneva (1558); by ~1580 his son Jacob settled in the Vallée de Joux.

## FUNCTION
Tragedy in 1791‑92 struck Suzanne ‘La Zanne’ Audemars (née Piguet), who lost husband and three children to disease yet trained her sons for horology.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Community support and multi‑skill resilience (lapidary, herbalist) sustained the family.

## INNOVATION
Louis‑Benjamin, aged 9 then, would become the family’s first to enter Swiss watchmaking history.
