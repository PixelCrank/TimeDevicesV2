# American Watchmaking Shakes Switzerland

## DESCRIPTION
Faced with collapsing exports to the U.S., Swiss watchmakers suddenly realized they were behind: the Americans now knew how to produce reliable, inexpensive watches — by machine.

## WHAT
In 1876, Swiss sales to the United States fell sharply. To understand this setback, Switzerland sent Édouard Favre-Perret to the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. His mission: analyze American processes. He discovered industrial watches of formidable precision, mass-produced and sold at low prices. The myth of Swiss superiority wavered.

## WHY
Favre-Perret’s report became a founding text of Swiss industrial watchmaking. He openly criticized Swiss complacency, accusing manufacturers of sabotaging their reputation by selling poor products to the U.S. Army. This national shock forced the Swiss to rethink their practices and triggered their shift toward mechanized watchmaking.

## STORY+
In Philadelphia, Favre-Perret bought a Waltham fifth-quality watch at random from a chest. In Paris, he set it to a public regulator: after 6 days, it had drifted only 32 seconds. Back in Le Locle, a master adjuster dismantled the watch, stunned: “I am blown away! We wouldn’t find a watch like this among 50,000 in our factory.”
