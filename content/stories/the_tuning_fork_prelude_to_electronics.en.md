# The Tuning Fork – Prelude to Electronics

## DESCRIPTION
Bulova’s 1960 Accutron used a 360 Hz tuning fork (by Max Hetzel) instead of a mechanical escapement.

## FUNCTION
Offered ±2 s/day class precision and long‑term stability; adopted for aerospace uses.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
A clear step into electronics, initially spurned by Swiss prestige houses before they licensed it.

## INNOVATION
Set the stage for the even more disruptive quartz revolution.
