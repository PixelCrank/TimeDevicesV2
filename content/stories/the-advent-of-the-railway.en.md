# The Advent of the Railway

## DESCRIPTION
Before rail, each town kept local solar time; mid‑19th‑century rail demanded strict coordination.

## FUNCTION
Telegraph distribution of time enabled legal, shared time across networks.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
The timepiece became a collective safety instrument and linchpin of industrial transport.

## INNOVATION
‘No railway without watches’: the pocket‑watch became a badge of modern civilisation.
