# The Advent of the Railway

## DESCRIPTION
Before the railway, each city kept its own local solar time, causing sometimes extreme discrepancies: in 1850, the United States had more than 100 local times, with up to three hours of difference between them.

Railway circulation required perfect coordination. Trains were stopped at precise points, on double tracks, using manual time calculations — with their share of errors and accidents.

Tested from 1837 in England, the telegraph made it possible to transmit the exact time instantly from a central office and allowed the establishment of a legal time common to a network.

The timekeeper thus became an instrument of collective safety and played a major role in the development of the railway and the industrial revolution that accompanied it.

## STORY+
Henri Vincenot speaks of “horlolâtrie”: “Before the railway, owning a watch was a mark of wealth; afterwards, it became proof of civilization. There is no civilization without the railway, and no railway without the watch.”
