# The Advent of Quartz

## DESCRIPTION
Late‑1960s miniaturisation put high‑frequency quartz into wristwatches (Seiko 1969), far more precise and cheaper than mechanical.

## FUNCTION
Though lab prototypes existed since 1927, only then were they wearable and mass‑producible.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Watchmaking became a techno‑industrial sector open to firms from electronics and beyond.

## INNOVATION
Swiss research helped, but commercial potential was underestimated—Japan seized the lead.
