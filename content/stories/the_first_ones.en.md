# The First "Watchmaking Workshops"

## DESCRIPTION
Ancient epigraphic inscriptions reveal the existence of the first workshops dedicated to making time-measuring instruments, presumably involving water clocks and sundials (even though the texts do not explicitly say so). These workshops employed skilled craftsmen, probably in the service of the city. The construction of these instruments was usually financed by magistrates (notably consuls), and they were installed in symbolic locations: political plazas, forums or courthouses.

## FUNCTION
These instruments were used by political authorities as a tool to legitimize their power, demonstrating their concern for order and management of civic time. They did not yet have a scientific or everyday function, but played a symbolic, public role associated with law, social organization and civic life.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
At that time, time was perceived as a social and cosmic phenomenon, governed by the movements of the sun and religious rituals. The goal was not to measure time precisely, but to embody political order in the heart of the city.

## INNOVATION
Their initial role was political, but these devices paved the way for a more public, civic and universal perception of time, which would expand in the following centuries. This was a foundational step toward the clock as a tool of collective regulation, long before its individual use.‚Äù
