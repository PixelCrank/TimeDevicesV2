# The First Ones

## DESCRIPTION
Ancient inscriptions point to early civic workshops making timeâ€‘measuring devices, likely clepsydras and sundials, financed by magistrates and installed in symbolic public spaces.

## FUNCTION
Used by city authorities to signal order and legitimate power; more emblematic than scientific or domestic.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Time was perceived as social and cosmic; the goal was to materialise political order rather than measure precisely.

## INNOVATION
A foundational step toward the clock as a tool of collective regulation, centuries before individual use.
