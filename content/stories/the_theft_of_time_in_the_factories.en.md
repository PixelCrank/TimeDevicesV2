# The Theft of Time in the Factories

## DESCRIPTION
With early industrialisation, workers suspected owners of cheating with factory clocks that disagreed with others in the area.

## FUNCTION
Workers bought cheap ‘onion’ watches to defend themselves; employers disliked this empowerment.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Given poor accuracy, disputes were as much social as technical.

## INNOVATION
Shows time as a contested instrument of workplace power and discipline.
