# Switzerland Dominates the Market

## DESCRIPTION
From ~1870 Switzerland provided over two‑thirds of world watch value, blending rooted traditions with gradual industrialisation.

## FUNCTION
Britain missed the turn and declined even as it led in other sectors; France persisted via Besançon; others lagged.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Swiss success fused craft with ‘soft’ modernisation and adaptability.

## INNOVATION
A warning sign for the UK: neglect of horology mirrored wider industrial complacency.
