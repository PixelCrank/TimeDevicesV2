# The Unification of Time

## DESCRIPTION
Rail networks drove national and then global time unification, with Greenwich as world reference after 1884.

## FUNCTION
Britain’s railways adopted Greenwich time from 1847 when telegraph distribution became possible.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Unified time improved industrial and social coordination and made exact time a daily imperative.

## INNOVATION
France resisted until 1911, even printing ‘Paris Mean Time minus 9m21s’ before yielding (then adding +1h).
