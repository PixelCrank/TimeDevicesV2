# The Établisseur (Watch Assembler)

## DESCRIPTION
The établisseur, usually a respected qualified watchmaker, organized production.

He chose the types of watches, distributed raw materials to subcontractors, advanced wages, collected and redistributed parts as work progressed, supervised finishing, and brought completed watches to market — either selling directly to consumers or via merchants for resale in distant cities.
