# The First Watchmakers of the Vallée de Joux

## DESCRIPTION
In 1740, a 19-year-old blacksmith’s son named Samuel Olivier Meylan left his native valley for the small town of Rolle, on the shores of Lake Geneva. His dream? To become a watchmaker.

At that time, watchmaking was regulated by corporations, which required eight years of apprenticeship before one could qualify as a watchmaker.

But after two years, out of money, Samuel Olivier Meylan returned to the Vallée de Joux. Against the rules of the Rolle Corporation, he began to pass on his knowledge to several apprentices, including brothers David and Pierre Golay.

The Vallée de Joux was so isolated and living conditions so harsh that the strict rules governing watchmaking were inapplicable.
But the young artisans were determined: in 1749 they obtained an exemption from the Bernese authorities. They created their own Corporation in 1756, before this system was abolished 20 years later to give birth to the freer Etablissage system.

Social ties were intense in the Vallée, and it was within families that watchmaking spread. The Piguet family, then the Audemars, took part very early in this dynamic.
