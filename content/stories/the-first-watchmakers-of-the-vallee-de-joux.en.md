# The First Watchmakers of the Vallée de Joux

## DESCRIPTION
Samuel Olivier Meylan left for Rolle to train but returned broke; against guild rules he taught apprentices in the valley.

## FUNCTION
Bernese authorities granted an exemption in 1749; a local corporation formed in 1756, later giving way to free‑form établissage.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
Family ties spread know‑how through Piguet and Audemars lines.

## INNOVATION
Isolation bred a pragmatic, liberty‑minded production system that foreshadowed later Swiss organisation.
