# The Timex Offensive

## DESCRIPTION
The Waterbury Clock Company, then in decline, revived itself with the Timex, a robust, simple, and inexpensive watch. This model inaugurated a new era: that of the mass-produced industrial watch, standardized, automated, and designed for a global market.

## WHAT
Swiss dominance, based on artisanal quality and diversity, became vulnerable to an ultra-industrial model based on volume. The success of Timex was dazzling: by 1960, just 11 years after its launch, the company produced 8 million watches per year, more than the entire Japanese industry at the time. In 1972, it produced 30 million watches annually and employed 17,000 workers in 20 factories worldwide.

## WHY
Timex embodied the American spirit of efficiency, aiming for a watch precise enough, very robust, and affordable for all. It found enthusiastic success among customers eager for a functional, inexpensive watch.

## STORY+
Timex watches were designed for almost every activity. Company representatives convinced retailers of their toughness by banging them against counters and plunging them into buckets of water.
