# The Timex Offensive

## DESCRIPTION
Waterbury relaunched as Timex: a robust, inexpensive, highly industrialised watch for a mass global market.

## FUNCTION
By 1960 it made ~8M watches/year; by 1972 ~30M with 17,000 employees across 20 plants.

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
‘Good enough’ precision plus durability and low price reshaped demand.

## INNOVATION
Retail theatrics proved toughness—sales reps banged watches on counters and dunked them in water.
