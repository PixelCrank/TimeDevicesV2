# Babylonian Gnomons

## DESCRIPTION
A simple upright rod whose moving shadow reveals the Sun’s path and the time of day and year.

## FUNCTION
It provided a practical way to measure or regulate time for daily life, science, navigation or ritual in Babylon (Mesopotamia).

## PERSPECTIVE
Dating to c. 1800–500 BCE, it reflects the needs and knowledge of its era and region, and how timekeeping spread from public monuments to personal devices.

## INNOVATION
It introduced or refined a key idea—such as regulated flow, shadow geometry, geared display, a stable oscillator or an electronic/atomic standard—that improved reliability and usability.
