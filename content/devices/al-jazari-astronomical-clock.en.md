# Al‑Jazari’s Astronomical Clock

## DESCRIPTION
A display that links hours with celestial cycles like the Sun, Moon, zodiac or planets.

## FUNCTION
It provided a practical way to measure or regulate time for daily life, science, navigation or ritual in Diyarbakır (Artuqid Anatolia).

## PERSPECTIVE
Dating to c. 1190–1210 CE, it reflects the needs and knowledge of its era and region, and how timekeeping spread from public monuments to personal devices.

## INNOVATION
It introduced or refined a key idea—such as regulated flow, shadow geometry, geared display, a stable oscillator or an electronic/atomic standard—that improved reliability and usability.
